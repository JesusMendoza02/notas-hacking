This program fixes vulnerabilities in its predecessor by limiting what
functions can be called to a table of predefined functions. This still puts
the user in charge, but prevents them from calling undesirable subroutines.

* Enter 'quit' to quit the program.
* Enter 'help' for this text.
* Enter 'reset' to reset the table.
* Enter '1' to execute the first function in the table.
* Enter '2' to execute the second function in the table.
* Enter '3' to execute the third function in the table.
* Enter '4' to execute the fourth function in the table.

Here's the current table:
  
1: print_table
2: read_variable
3: write_variable
4: getRandomNumber
==> 3
Please enter variable name to write: getRandomNumber
Please enter new value of variable: win
==> 2                  
Please enter variable name to read: getRandomNumber
<function win at 0x7a2095567dc0>
==> 4
